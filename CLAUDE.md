## What is Sentra?

Sentra is a **voice-first AI assistant web application** that provides:
- **Modern web interface** using Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Universal browser access** on any platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Cloud backend** for synchronization and collaboration
- **Perfect voice support** with browser echo cancellation

### Vision
Create the most natural way to interact with AI - through voice - while maintaining the power of traditional interfaces.

**Dashboard Vision:** Mission control center for managing multiple AI-powered projects simultaneously. Users should see all project activity at a glance, create new projects without touching the terminal, review PRs in-app, and control voice notifications per-project. The dashboard uses a true dark theme with professional dark cards, violet accents, and actionable intelligence.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

**Frontend (Web Application)**
- Next.js 15.5 with React 19 (App Router, React Server Components)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching

**Backend (Cloud Services)**
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL (primary database)
- Drizzle ORM (edge-compatible)
- Redis (caching, sessions)

**AI/Voice**
- OpenAI Whisper (speech-to-text)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (language model)
- OpenAI TTS (text-to-speech)

### Security Architecture

**Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions (Phases 1-2), Custom runners with gVisor (Phase 3)

**Approved Security Model (Glen Barnhardt, Nov 12, 2025):**
Sentra implements a 3-phase security architecture for AI agent isolation:

**Phase 1: Docker Containerization (THIS WEEK)**
- AI agents run in isolated Docker containers on GitHub Actions
- Read-only root filesystem with ephemeral tmpfs mounts
- Non-root user execution (claude-agent:claude-agent)
- Capability dropping (CAP_DROP=ALL with minimal additions)
- Resource limits: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 100 processes max
- Risk reduction: 60-70%

**Phase 2: Credential Proxy Service (Weeks 2-4)**
- Credentials never exposed to agent container environment
- Unix socket-based proxy service validates requests
- GitHub tokens and API keys remain on host, attached by proxy
- Full audit trail of all credential usage
- Prevents credential theft via prompt injection attacks
- Risk reduction: Additional 30% (CRITICAL)

**Phase 3: gVisor Migration (Q1 2026)**
- Custom infrastructure with Google's gVisor runtime
- User-space kernel eliminates direct syscall exposure
- Industry-leading security matching Claude Code for Web
- Requires migration off GitHub Actions
- Risk reduction: Remaining 15% gap

**Current Status:** Phase 1 implementation starting this week

**Agent Execution Engine:** Claude Code CLI (NOT Anthropic SDK)
- We use `claude` CLI command to execute GitHub issues
- DO NOT migrate to direct Anthropic SDK without reading architecture doc
- See: `.claude/docs/ARCHITECTURE-AGENT-WORKER.md` for complete rationale
- Benefits: agent ecosystem, quality hooks, auto-updates, proven reliability

**Why NOT direct SDK?**
- Would lose specialized agents (orchestrator, test-writer, code-reviewer)
- Would lose quality hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop validation)
- Would lose automatic updates from Anthropic
- Would need to build tool execution, context management ourselves
- 2-4 weeks development + ongoing maintenance for no real benefit

## Development Standards

### TypeScript

**Strict Mode is MANDATORY**
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Explicit types
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
}

// ❌ DON'T: Using 'any'
function processData(data: any) { }

// ❌ DON'T: Using @ts-ignore
// @ts-ignore
const value = getData()

// ✅ DO: Use type guards instead
function isCartItem(obj: unknown): obj is CartItem {
  return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && 'price' in obj
}
```

### Testing Requirements

**Coverage Thresholds**
- **Overall**: 75%+ (enforced by CI/CD)
- **Business Logic** (src/services/): 90%+ (enforced by CI/CD)
- **Utilities** (src/utils/): 90%+ (enforced by CI/CD)
- **UI Components**: 60%+ (visual components)

**E2E Tests Required For:**
- Critical user journeys (signup, checkout, payment flows)
- **ALL visual state changes** (color, visibility, position, animation)
- **Multi-step interactions** (click → modal → action → result)
- **User-facing state transitions** (loading → success, enabled → disabled)

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
1. Write tests FIRST
2. Verify tests FAIL
3. Write implementation
4. Verify tests PASS
5. Refactor as needed

**Test Structure (AAA Pattern)**
```typescript
describe('AuthService', () => {
  describe('register', () => {
    it('should create user with hashed password', async () => {
      // ARRANGE: Setup test data
      const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'Pass123!' }

      // ACT: Execute the behavior
      const result = await authService.register(userData)

      // ASSERT: Verify outcome
      expect(result.id).toBeDefined()
      expect(result).not.toHaveProperty('password')
    })
  })
})
```

### Code Quality

**Linting**: ESLint with strict rules (0 errors, 0 warnings)

**Formatting**: Prettier (enforced by pre-commit hooks)

**No Debug Code**
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T: Leave console.log in production code
console.log('User data:', user)

// ✅ DO: Use proper logger
logger.info('User registered', { userId: user.id })
```

### Security

**Never commit secrets**
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk_live_abc123'

// ✅ DO: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
if (!apiKey) throw new Error('OPENAI_API_KEY not configured')
```

**Input validation is mandatory**
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Validate all input
function createUser(input: unknown) {
  const validated = userSchema.parse(input) // Zod validation
  return db.user.create({ data: validated })
}
```

### Git Workflow

**Branching Strategy**
- `main`: Production-ready code (protected)
- `feature/*`: New features (e.g., `feature/voice-commands`)
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/audio-echo`)

## Known Gotchas

### Voice System Architecture
**Pattern**: Always-on microphone with browser echo cancellation (WebRTC mode)

**CRITICAL DECISION (November 2025):**
We chose **Option A: Trust Industry Pattern** for voice echo cancellation. This is documented in:
- `/docs/architecture/VOICE-SYSTEM.md` - Decision 4
- `/docs/decisions/ADR-001-VOICE-ECHO-CANCELLATION.md` - Full decision record

**How it works**:
- Microphone track remains enabled throughout the conversation
- Browser's native echo cancellation (`echoCancellation: true`) prevents feedback loops
- Audio playback stays in browser pipeline (HTMLAudioElement only)
- Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) handles turn detection
- No manual track toggling needed - this is the industry standard used by ChatGPT voice

**Why AudioWorklet was never needed:**
- Web application runs natively in browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Browser's native echo cancellation works perfectly across all platforms
- No desktop Tauri WKWebView limitations - we're 100% web-based now

**Architecture:**
```
✅ CORRECT (echo cancellation works in all browsers):
Microphone → getUserMedia → RTCPeerConnection → OpenAI
    ↑ AEC compares signals ↓
HTMLAudioElement ← RTCPeerConnection (browser sees both)
```

**Location**: `src/lib/openai-realtime.ts`

**DO NOT**:
- Implement AudioWorklet bypass to native audio
- Manually toggle microphone (pauseRecording/resumeRecording)
- Add artificial delays for echo prevention
- Try to "improve" browser echo cancellation

**Why web-only is better**:
- Echo cancellation works perfectly on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux, mobile)
- No WKWebView audio limitations
- No Tauri desktop integration complexity
- Universal access - just open URL, no installation needed
- Easier deployment and updates

### Next.js Server Components
**Problem**: Can't use client-side APIs (localStorage, window) in Server Components

**Solution**: Use `'use client'` directive when needed

```typescript
// Client Component (needs browser APIs)
'use client'
import { useState } from 'react'

export function VoiceRecorder() {
  const [recording, setRecording] = useState(false)
  // Can use browser APIs here
}
```

## AI Agent Guidelines

When working on Sentra with Claude Code agents:

### DO:
- **Write tests FIRST** (TDD approach)
- **Ask for plan approval** before implementing features
- **Use specialized agents** (test-writer, implementation, code-reviewer)
- **Run tests after EVERY change**
- **Verify coverage meets thresholds**
- **Check TypeScript compilation** (npx tsc --noEmit)
- **Follow dashboard design** (true dark theme, mission control layout)
- **Support multi-project workflows** (grid layout, per-project controls)

### DON'T:
- **Modify tests** without explicit permission (tests are the specification)
- **Use `any` or `@ts-ignore`** (TypeScript strict mode)
- **Bypass git hooks** (--no-verify is BLOCKED)
- **Commit without tests passing** (enforced by Stop hook)
- **Skip code review** (multi-agent review is mandatory)
- **Create minimalistic UIs** (use mission control design with rich features)
- **Use light colors** (true dark theme is mandatory)
- **Migrate to Anthropic SDK** (we use Claude Code CLI - see architecture doc)

### Multi-Agent Workflow

**For new features, use orchestrator agent**:
1. Orchestrator creates plan → gets user approval
2. Orchestrator spawns test-writer → writes tests FIRST
3. Orchestrator spawns implementation → makes tests pass
4. Orchestrator spawns code-reviewer → finds bugs
5. Orchestrator spawns test-runner → verifies all pass
6. (Optional) Orchestrator spawns security-auditor for sensitive code

**Why?** Single agents get tunnel vision. Multi-agent review catches 90.2% more issues.

## Notes for Claude Code

**This project uses the Perfect Agentic Structure**:
- 6-layer defense system prevents bugs from being committed
- PreToolUse hooks BLOCK dangerous operations (git --no-verify)
- PostToolUse hooks VALIDATE every file change
- Stop hook is UNBYPASSABLE - runs comprehensive quality gate

**The 9-month bug pain will NEVER happen again** because:
1. Git bypass is blocked at 3 layers (settings, hook, MCP)
2. Tests must be written FIRST (enforced by workflow)
3. Multi-agent review catches issues single agent misses
4. Stop hook prevents finishing until ALL checks pass
5. CI/CD enforces quality gates (cannot be bypassed)

**Agent Architecture (CRITICAL)**:
- We use Claude Code CLI for agent execution, NOT Anthropic SDK
- DO NOT migrate to SDK - it would lose agent ecosystem, quality hooks, auto-updates
- See `.claude/docs/ARCHITECTURE-AGENT-WORKER.md` for complete rationale
- This decision is final unless ALL criteria in architecture doc are met (they won't be)

**When in doubt**:
- Check PERFECT-AGENTIC-STRUCTURE.md for complete workflow
- Check `.claude/docs/ARCHITECTURE-AGENT-WORKER.md` before changing agent execution
- Use orchestrator agent for complex features
- Write tests FIRST, always
- Get code review before finishing

## Edge-First Architecture

**ORM Decision:** Drizzle (not Prisma)

Sentra uses Drizzle ORM to enable Vercel Edge Runtime capabilities:
- **Vercel Edge Functions** - Ultra-low latency globally
- **Next.js 15 Server Actions** - Full support without limitations
- **Edge Runtime** - 0ms cold starts worldwide

Prisma 6.19.0 blocks Vercel Edge Runtime due to Node.js dependencies. Drizzle is edge-first and works everywhere.

**See:** `docs/decisions/ADR-002-DRIZZLE-ORM-MIGRATION.md` for complete rationale
