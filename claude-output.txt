The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary - Issue #26: Replace Mock Data with Real Project Scanning

### Files Created:

1. **`src/services/github-scanner.ts`** - GitHub Repository Scanner Service
   - `GitHubScanner` class with in-memory caching (5 min TTL)
   - `scanRepositories()` - Fetches all user repos via GitHub API with pagination
   - `checkSentraEnabled()` - Checks for `.claude/` directory to identify Sentra-enabled repos
   - `filterRepositories()` - Filters by archived, forks, language
   - `createProjectInput()` - Transforms GitHub repos into Sentra project format
   - Cache management methods for efficiency

2. **`src/app/api/github/scan/route.ts`** - API Endpoint
   - `GET /api/github/scan` - Scans user's GitHub repos, marks already-imported ones
   - `POST /api/github/scan` - Imports selected repos as Sentra projects
   - Query params: `excludeArchived`, `excludeForks`, `language`, `limit`, `sentraEnabledOnly`, `forceRefresh`
   - Proper error handling for missing token, rate limits, etc.

3. **`src/hooks/useGitHubScan.ts`** - React Hook
   - `useGitHubScan()` hook for client-side scanning/importing
   - Uses React Query for caching and state management
   - `scan()`, `importRepos()`, `importAllRepos()` actions
   - Auto-invalidates projects/dashboard queries after import

4. **`tests/unit/services/github-scanner.test.ts`** - Scanner Tests
   - Tests for caching, filtering, transformation logic
   - Tests for Sentra enablement detection

5. **`tests/unit/api/github-scan.test.ts`** - API Tests
   - Tests for GET endpoint with various scenarios
   - Tests for POST import functionality
   - Error handling tests

### Key Features:
- **5-minute in-memory cache** to respect GitHub rate limits
- **Pagination support** for users with many repos (up to 5000)
- **Sentra enablement detection** via `.claude/` directory check
- **Import tracking** - marks which repos are already imported as projects
- **Filtering options** - exclude archived/forks, filter by language

### Files to Stage:
```
src/services/github-scanner.ts
src/app/api/github/scan/route.ts
src/hooks/useGitHubScan.ts
tests/unit/services/github-scanner.test.ts
tests/unit/api/github-scan.test.ts
```

The implementation is ready to be committed. The git add commands require approval to proceed with the commit and PR creation.
