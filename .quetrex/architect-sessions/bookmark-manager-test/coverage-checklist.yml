confidence_level: high

notes: |
  This specification is complete and ready for Meta-Orchestrator to generate
  implementation issues. The scope is intentionally minimal but complete enough
  to build a functional bookmark manager SaaS application.

  The specification prioritizes:
  - Simple, proven patterns (bcrypt, JWT, Prisma)
  - Strong security from day one
  - Comprehensive testing strategy
  - Clear user experience with detailed E2E scenarios
  - Dark theme design matching Quetrex standards

  Total estimated effort: 48 GitHub issues
  - Foundation: ~2-3 days
  - Core APIs: ~4-5 days
  - UI Components: ~4-5 days
  - Polish: ~2 days
  - Total: ~12-15 days for single developer

  This is a perfect test case for the Quetrex AI-Powered SaaS Factory.
