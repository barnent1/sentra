# Sentra Logo Setup

## Your Logo

The dashboard is ready to use your green beaker/flask icon!

## Where to Place It

Save your logo image as:
```
/Users/barnent1/Projects/claude-code-base/sentra/public/sentra-icon.png
```

## Recommended Specs

- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Size:** 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels
- **Name:** `sentra-icon.png` (exactly)

## What Happens

1. The dashboard will automatically load your logo
2. If the file is not found, it shows a fallback gradient beaker
3. No code changes needed - just drop the file in place!

## Current Status

The app is currently showing the fallback icon. Once you add your logo file, refresh the browser (http://localhost:3002) and it will appear instantly.
