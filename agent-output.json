## Summary

I have successfully implemented Task 1.2: Add Spec Badge to Project Card. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made

**1. `src/components/ProjectCard.tsx`**
- Added logic to detect pending specs: `project.specs?.find(spec => !spec.isApproved)`
- Calculate spec file size in KB if available
- Added a new badge section that displays when a pending spec exists
- Badge features:
  - Violet/purple color scheme (`bg-violet-500/20`, `border-violet-500/50`)
  - Pulsing animation (`animate-pulse
