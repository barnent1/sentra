I see that git commands require approval. Let me create a simple summary of the implementation instead:

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented **Task 1.2: Add Spec Badge to Project Card** as specified in Issue #2.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `src/components/ProjectCard.tsx`

### Implementation Details

1. **Added pending spec detection logic:**
   - Checks `project.pendingSpec` field
   - Also checks `project.specs` array for unapproved specs
   - Calculates file s

The fix has been applied. The issue was that JWT_SECRET validation was happening at module load time (during the build phase), which caused the build to fail. I've moved the validation into a `getJWTSecrets()` function that only runs at request time, allowing the build to succeed while still ensuring the environment variable is validated when the route is actually used.

Perfect! The fix is correct. The JWT_SECRET environment variable check has been moved from module load time (which causes build errors) to runtime inside the `generateTokens` function. This allows the build to succeed while still maintaining proper error handling at runtime when the routes are actually called.

## Summary of Changes

Fixed the build error by moving JWT_SECRET environment variable validation from module load time to runtime:

1. **src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts**: Moved JWT_S
