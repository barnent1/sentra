---

## Critical Paths

The following paths contain critical code that must not be broken:

1. **Business Logic** (`src/services/`)
   - Protection: Requires 90%+ test coverage
   - Changes need comprehensive tests

2. **Backend API** (`backend/src/`)
   - Protection: Requires 90%+ test coverage
   - Breaking changes require API versioning

3. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
   - Protection: Requires migration
   - Changes need backward compatibility review

4. **Authentication** (`src/services/auth`, `backend/src/middleware/auth`)
   - Protection: Requires security review
   - Changes are security-sensitive

---

## Protection Rules

Protection rules are defined in `.quetrex/protection/protection-rules.yml`:
- Critical path identification
- Breaking change detection
- Required reviews for sensitive areas
- Safe modification zones

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Protection Rules:**
   ```bash
   cat .quetrex/protection/protection-rules.yml
   ```

2. **Review Detected Patterns:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/existing-codebase/patterns/detected-patterns.md
   ```

3. **Start Adding Features:**
   - Use Meta Orchestrator to plan new features
   - Follow existing patterns for consistency
   - Maintain test coverage thresholds
   - Protection rules enforce safety

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

---

## Warnings

⚠️ **Critical Path Changes:**
- Changes to `src/services/` require 90%+ test coverage
- Database schema changes require migrations
- API changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Auth changes require security review

⚠️ **Breaking Changes:**
- Detected automatically by protection rules
- Blocked if they violate safety requirements
- Must be explicitly reviewed and approved

⚠️ **Test Coverage:**
- Overall: Must maintain 75%+
- Services: Must maintain 90%+
- Utils: Must maintain 90%+
- Enforced by CI/CD

---

## Safe Zones

These areas are safe to modify without strict protection:
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `tests/` - Test additions
- `.quetrex/` - Quetrex configuration
